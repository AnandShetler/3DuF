### Disclaimer

This is an active research project, and as such, this codebase could (and should) change dramatically as the code matures and new features are implemented. The master branch should always be functional, but we make no guarantee of backwards-compatability with previous versions. Expect bugs, excessive re-factoring, and cheeky commit messages.

###Questions?

Please email Aaron at awh@bu.edu with any questions, comments, complaints, or pictures of printed molds.
